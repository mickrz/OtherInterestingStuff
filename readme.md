# Other Interesting Stuff...

Here are a handful or so of interesting presentations, papers and pseudo-project plans I've created in the past.

* **Master's Professional Paper: "Fault tolerance and reliability in software"** - I wrote about software fault tolerance mechanisms covering software black boxes and approaches to software development to reduce software faults. I was very humbled and honored that my advisor mentioned me in the Acknowledgements section of his book ["Software Engineering for Image Processing Systems"](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Image-Processing-Systems/dp/0849313767). He's also referenced my work in other books he has written which honestly is just really cool!

* **Cybercrime 101 with a focus on Identity Theft** - I researched, wrote and presented this to my flotilla of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary after a personal experience I had. It was a lot of fun to research and organize this presentation. I probably spent about 80-100 hours on it but I liked how it came together. It's a bit dated now given this area, but much is still relevant. There are some links to videos off of the FTC website that are not linked in the presentation. I've listed them below for reference.
  - [Five Ways to Help Protect Your Identity](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/video-0023-five-ways-help-protect-your-identity)
  - [Sharing Information: A Day in Your Life](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/video-0022-sharing-information-day-your-life)
  - [IdentityTheft.gov Helps You Report and Recover from Identity Theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/video-0123-identitytheftgov-helps-you-report-and-recover-identity-theft)
  - [Recovering from Identity Theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/video-0102-recovering-identity-theft)
  - [The FTC has lots of informative videos though...](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media)
  
* **Your Boat's Radio** - I created this to satisfy a requirement to obtain the Instructor Training certification in the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. This was fun to develop and present.

* **Agents in Home Automation** - I created this for a class in Artificial Intelligence. The Agents concept never really took off AFAIK, but reinforcement learning and GANs seem to be incorporated into networking R&D for various components in SDNs. Pretty cool.

* **Awareness of Vulnerabilities on our Computers and Consumer Electronics** - I wrote this as part of a newsletter to help educate fellow shipmates of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary on computer security. At the time, viruses were relatively harmless compared to today's threats. I guess it shouldn't be surprising how much this area has evolved.

* **School Software Project Plan** - This was scanned into a pdf so the quality isn't ideal. That said, I enjoyed this course at Penn State because it gave me insight into the other side of software development and not just my piece of the puzzle.
